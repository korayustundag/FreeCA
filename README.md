## What is FreeCA?
FreeCA is a free security certification software. You can provide yourself with as many Code Signing or SSL certificates as you want. Create free certificates that you can normally only get for a fee.
Only Code Signing Certificates but for now.

**Don't forget to add the root certificate to your trusted root certificate authorities repository.**
